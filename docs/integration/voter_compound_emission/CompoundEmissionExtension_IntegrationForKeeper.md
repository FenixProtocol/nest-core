# CompoundEmissionExtensionUpgradeable: Integration for Keeper

This document describes how to integrate the `compoundEmissionClaimBatch` function within the `CompoundEmissionExtensionUpgradeable` contract for Keepers. The function allows batch compounding of emissions for multiple users by claiming rewards and splitting them into veNFT locks and bribe pools according to each user's configuration.

---

## Relevant Method

### `compoundEmissionClaimBatch(ClaimParams[] calldata claimsParams_)`

**Signature:**
```solidity
function compoundEmissionClaimBatch(ClaimParams[] calldata claimsParams_) external;
```

**Description:**
Triggers the compounding of emissions for multiple users in a single batch operation. This includes:
1. Claiming rewards from gauges for each user.
2. Optionally claiming additional rewards via a Merkl proof.
3. Locking the portion of emissions allocated to veNFT locks according to each user's configuration.
4. Sending the portion of emissions allocated to bribe pools to their respective targets.

**Parameters:**
- **claimsParams_**: An array of `ClaimParams` structs, where each struct contains the following fields:
  - **target**: `address` - The user for whom the emissions are being compounded.
  - **gauges**: `address[]` - The list of gauge contracts to claim rewards from.
  - **merkl**: `IVoter.AggregateClaimMerklDataParams` - Merkl proof data for claiming additional rewards.

**Requirements:**
- The caller must have the `COMPOUND_KEEPER_ROLE`.
- Ensure that the `target` address and related parameters are configured correctly for each user.

## Steps for Keeper Integration

1. **Check Permissions:**
   Ensure the Keeper address has been assigned the `COMPOUND_KEEPER_ROLE` in the `CompoundEmissionExtensionUpgradeable` contract.

2. **Prepare Input Data:**
   Gather the necessary information for each user in the form of `ClaimParams`. This includes:
   - User addresses (`target`).
   - Gauges from which to claim emissions (`gauges`).
   - Merkl proof data for additional rewards (`merkl`).

   **Example:**
   ```solidity
   ClaimParams[] memory claims = new ClaimParams[](2);

   claims[0] = ClaimParams({
       target: 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678,
       gauges: [0xabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdef],
       merkl: IVoter.AggregateClaimMerklDataParams({
           users: [0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678],
           tokens: [0x9876543210abcdef9876543210abcdef98765432],
           amounts: [1000],
           proofs: [["0xabc...", "0xdef..."]]
       })
   });

   claims[1] = ClaimParams({
       target: 0xabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdef,
       gauges: [0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678],
       merkl: IVoter.AggregateClaimMerklDataParams({
           users: [0xabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdef],
           tokens: [0x9876543210abcdef9876543210abcdef98765432],
           amounts: [500],
           proofs: [["0xghi...", "0xjkl..."]]
       })
   });
   ```

3. **Execute the Batch Claim:**
   Call the `compoundEmissionClaimBatch` method with the prepared `ClaimParams` array.

   **Example:**
   ```solidity
   compoundEmissionExtension.compoundEmissionClaimBatch(claims);
   ```

4. **Monitor Events:**
   Listen for the following events to verify the success of the operation:
   - `CreateLockFromCompoundEmission`: Indicates a new veNFT lock was created.
   - `CompoundEmissionToTargetLock`: Indicates tokens were deposited into an existing veNFT lock.
   - `CompoundEmissionToBribePool`: Indicates tokens were distributed to a bribe pool.

---

## Example Use Case

**Scenario:**
The Keeper needs to compound emissions for two users, claiming rewards from specific gauges and distributing them according to user configurations.

**Solution:**
1. Prepare the `ClaimParams` for each user.
2. Call the `compoundEmissionClaimBatch` method with the array of claims.
3. Verify the emitted events for successful execution.

**Code Example:**
```solidity
ClaimParams[] memory claims = new ClaimParams[](2);

claims[0] = ClaimParams({
    target: 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678,
    gauges: [0xabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdef],
    merkl: {}
});

claims[1] = ClaimParams({
    target: 0xabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdef,
    gauges: [0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678],
    merkl: {}
});

// Execute the batch claim
compoundEmissionExtension.compoundEmissionClaimBatch(claims);
```

---

## Additional Notes

- Keepers must ensure that all parameters in `ClaimParams` are correct and aligned with the users' configurations.
- Proper gas estimation should be performed before calling the batch function to avoid out-of-gas errors.
- Each user’s configuration will dictate how the claimed emissions are split into veNFT locks and bribe pools.
- The `CompoundEmissionExtensionUpgradeable` contract automatically validates gauge liveness and other constraints during execution.
